# InterSchem
A simple logic scheme visualizer, allowing the user to create, edit, load and save, export and run different logic schemes.
Made in collaboration with Tudor BÄƒlan.
## Using InterSchem
We'll walk you through some of the things you can do in InterSchem.
### Inserting a block <br>
To insert a block, simply click on the `Insert` button. The insert menu will show up on the left hand side where you can select the type of block you wish to insert.
<br>
There are numerous blocks to choose from. A valid logic scheme must always have a `Start` block and a `Stop` block. Other blocks will require an input from the user before being inserted.

### Connecting two blocks <br>
In order to connect two blocks, simply click on the circle belonging to the starting block to commence pairing. After that, click on the block you wish to be connected to.
